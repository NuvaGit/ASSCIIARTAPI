# Animated ASCII Terminal Display

A dynamic Node.js server that streams vibrant ASCII art directly to your terminal.

---

## How It Works
The server generates animated ASCII art that updates in real time. Itâ€™s deployed on Render, so you can access it immediately without local setup.
Render servers shut down due to inactivity so u need to run it a bunch of times like wait 1 mins then it works

## Quick Start

2. **Run:**
